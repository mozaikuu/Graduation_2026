1. Domestic / Household

Space heating: radiators, furnaces, under-floor systems, fireplaces

Cooking & food prep: stovetops, ovens, grills, toasters

Hot water supply: showers, baths, dishwashers, laundry

Drying clothes (dryers, clotheslines using sun/ambient heat)

Home saunas, steam rooms, and heated pools

Personal comfort items (heating pads, electric blankets)

2. Agricultural

Greenhouse heating to maintain optimal plant growth

Soil sterilization and frost protection

Drying crops, grains, herbs, and tobacco

Livestock housing (incubators, brooders, barn heaters)

Pasteurization of milk on farms

Composting (controlled heat for decomposition)

3. Industrial & Manufacturing

Process heat (often the biggest industrial energy use):

Metal smelting, forging, welding

Glass blowing and ceramics kilns

Chemical reactions requiring high temperatures (ammonia, plastics)

Food processing, pasteurization, canning, baking

Textile dyeing and finishing

Steam generation for turbines and machinery

Drying, curing, and setting materials (paint, paper, lumber)

Desalination via thermal distillation

Refining petroleum and petrochemicals

4. Energy & Power

Thermal power plants (coal, gas, nuclear) to drive steam turbines

Concentrated solar power (mirrors focusing sunlight to create steam)

Geothermal energy extraction

District heating networks delivering steam/hot water to buildings

Waste heat recovery to produce electricity or warm water

5. Transportation

Engine combustion and propulsion (cars, ships, airplanes)

Cabin heating in vehicles, aircraft, trains

De-icing runways or rail switches

Exhaust heat recovery systems

6. Environmental & Ecological

Controlled burns for forest management

Accelerating compost or bio-digester processes

Soil warming for habitat restoration

Melting snow/ice for flood management

7. Municipal & Public Services

Street and sidewalk snow-melt systems

Public bathhouses, spas, and hot springs facilities

Large-scale laundry or kitchen operations in hospitals, hotels, prisons

Waste treatment (sludge drying, incineration)

8. Recreational

Hot tubs, saunas, thermal spas

Cooking fires for camping and outdoor grilling

Heated sports fields (e.g., under-turf coils in stadiums)

Glass blowing or pottery as hobbies

9. Cultural & Religious

Ritual fires and cremations

Candles, incense burning, and temple lamps

Festival bonfires and ceremonial pyres

10. Scientific & Medical

Laboratory furnaces and autoclaves (sterilization)

Incubators for cell culture or bacterial growth

Medical therapies: heat packs, hyperthermia treatment, cauterization

Spacecraft thermal control systems

Controlled environments for experiments (climate chambers)

11. Emergency & Military

Field kitchens and portable heaters for troops

Decontamination using heat/steam

Flame-based signaling or flares

Controlled demolition (thermite, cutting torches)

12. Emerging / High-Tech
